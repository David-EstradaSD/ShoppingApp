# ShoppingApp (_Advanced Redux_)

### Overview
Built this app while teaching myself _Advanced Redux_, particularly Side Effects and Asynchronous Code. I use [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the backend to persist data and store it.

### Technologies
* React, Redux, JavaScript
* HttpRequests / Asynchronous Functions with Redux
* Side Effects (_useEffect_)
* Data Store (_Actions, Payloads, Reducers_)
* Redux Toolkit
* [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) 
* Custom React Hooks (_useSelector, useDispatch_)
* Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This app was part of an advanced lesson on Redux. I learned how to send and fetch data with Redux and handle side effects, as well as implement logic in Redux "store actions" and utilize those in other components. This project was built while I was learning React through one of Udemy's online courses ( 48+ hours ).
