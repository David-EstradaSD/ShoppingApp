# ShoppingApp (_Advanced Redux_)

### Overview
I worked on this basic app while teaching myself _Advanced Redux_, particularly Side Effects and Asynchronous Code.

### Technologies
* React, Redux, JavaScript
* HttpRequests / Asynchronous Functions with Redux
* Side Effects (_useEffect_)
* Data Store
* Redux Toolkit
* Custom React Hooks (_useSelector, useDispatch_)
* Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This app was part of an advanced lesson on Redux. I learned how to send Async HttpRequests with Redux and handle side effects. This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
