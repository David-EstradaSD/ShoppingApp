# ShoppingApp (_Advanced Redux_)

### Overview
Built this app while teaching myself _Advanced Redux_, particularly Side Effects and Asynchronous Code. I use [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the backend to persist data and store it.

### Technologies Used
* React, Redux, JavaScript
* HttpRequests / Asynchronous Functions with Redux
* Side Effects (_useEffect_)
* Data Store (_Actions, Payloads, Reducers_)
* Redux Toolkit
* [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) 
* Custom React Hooks (_useSelector, useDispatch_)
* Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is not deployed and thus, can only be run locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This app was part of an advanced lesson on Redux. I learned how to send and fetch data with Redux and handle side effects, as well as implement logic in Redux "_store actions_" and utilize those in other components.
